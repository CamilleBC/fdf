# FDF

**Fil de fer (Iron wire)**

This project is an introduction to graphic programming, and in particular how to place points in space, how to join them with segments, and, most importantly, how to observe the scene from a particular viewpoint.

This project uses graphic library: miniLibX. This library was developed internally at 42, and includes the minimum necessary to open a window, light a pixel and deal with events linked to this window: keyboard and mouse.
